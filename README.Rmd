**Aim of the package**

**fwtraits** provides a seamless and robust access to the species ecological parameters, traits or indicators from the **Freshwaterecology.info database** (Schmidt-Kloiber, A., & Hering, D 2015).

**Package installation**

The package is currently accessible of GitHub

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("AnthonyBasooma/fwtraits")

```
**Package usage**

---
The database is arranged into organism groups including macroinvertebrates, fishes, phytoplankton, macrophytes, and phytobenthos most especially the diatoms (Figure 1). The package is a wrapper around the [fweapi2](https://www.freshwaterecology.info/fweapi2docu.php) developed and maintained by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), Vienna, Austria.

Before using the package, the user is strongly advised to run the **`fw_b4ustart()`** to get the steps required to access and use the package in accessing the species eological parameters, traits or indicators.

**Main functions**

* `fw_token()` for generating the user authentication token to allow manage data access and maintenance. The `fw_token()` requires the API key which is obtained during registration or submitting a request to the database managers for already registered users.
* `fw_searchdata()` To allow get data from the database. However, this is mostly an internal function since the data is not already parsed to enable usability.
* `fw_extract()` extracts the pulled data but still the data is cannot be used by the user.
* `fw_fetchdata()` is the main function that provides all the parameters for data access. The function is wrapped around `fw_searchdata()` and `fw_extract()` function to allow the user to easily get and manipulate the data during package usage.

**Other utility functions**

* `fw_decache()`to remove cached downloaded from the database from the user computer.
* `fw_check_names()` to check spellings species taxonomic names to allow the user obtain the species traits.
* `fw_checktraits()`harmonize species traits to allow effective between user inputs and database information.
* `fw_visualize()`provides graphical display of the information obtained from the database.

**Quick notes**

* The package allows parallel computing, where different can be obtained or organism groups can be accessed simultaneously. 
* The data is cached to allow user save information on ther user computer.

**Funding**

The package was created with support from the AquaINFRA project which is aimed at developing data and services to support marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders. Also, the DANUBE4All project and HR21 Doctoral School under BOKU University provided logistical support during the development of this package.
